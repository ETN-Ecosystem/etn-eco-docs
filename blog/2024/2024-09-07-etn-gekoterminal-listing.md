We are excited to announce a significant milestone for the ETN Ecosystem: the official listing of the $ETN token on **GekoTerminal** on September 7, 2024!

<!--truncate-->

This listing marks a crucial step in increasing the visibility and accessibility of $ETN to a broader audience of traders and investors. GekoTerminal is a well-regarded crypto-tracking platform, and its inclusion of $ETN will provide enhanced data, charts, and market insights for our community and potential new holders.

This achievement reflects the growing recognition of the ETN Ecosystem's real-world utility and our commitment to building a robust and transparent decentralized economy. We believe this listing will contribute to greater liquidity and foster wider adoption of the $ETN token as we continue to expand our suite of platforms and services.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build and grow the ETN Ecosystem!
