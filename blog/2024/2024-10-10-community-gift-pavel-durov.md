On October 10, 2024, the ETN Ecosystem community came together to send a special birthday gift to Pavel Durov, the visionary founder of Telegram: a symbolic amount of $ETN tokens.

<!--truncate-->

This gesture was more than just a birthday wish; it was an expression of deep appreciation for the Telegram platform, which serves as a crucial backbone for the ETN Ecosystem and its vibrant community. Telegram's robust and accessible infrastructure has been instrumental in our growth and ability to connect with users across Africa and beyond.

The community's hope is that these $ETN tokens will be held by Pavel Durov until they gain significant value, potentially even enough to fund future Telegram server purchases. This highlights our belief in the long-term potential of $ETN and the symbiotic relationship between the ETN Ecosystem and the broader TON/Telegram network.

This initiative underscores the strong bond and shared vision between the ETN community and the foundational technologies that enable our decentralized solutions.
