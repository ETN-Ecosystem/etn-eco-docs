We are pleased to announce that **ETN Ads** has officially entered its closed alpha testing phase as of October 12, 2024! This marks a significant step forward for the platform, which was developed during a hackathon challenge by a dedicated community member.

ETN Ads is designed to be an innovative advertising portal within the ETN Ecosystem, connecting content creators with potential advertisers and offering a new avenue for revenue generation, especially in regions with limited online payment gateways like Ethiopia.

The transition to closed alpha testing signifies that the core functionalities are in place and are now being rigorously tested by a select group of users. This phase is crucial for gathering valuable feedback, identifying any bugs, and refining the user experience before a broader release.

This milestone highlights our commitment to fostering community-driven product innovation and bringing practical, decentralized solutions to market. We look forward to the insights gained from this testing phase to make ETN Ads a robust and effective platform for all users.
