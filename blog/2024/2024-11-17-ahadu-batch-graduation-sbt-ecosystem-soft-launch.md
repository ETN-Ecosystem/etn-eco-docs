November 17, 2024, marked a monumental day for the ETN Ecosystem as we celebrated the graduation of the first cohort from the **Ultimate Netsa Summer Bootcamp**, proudly dubbed the "**Ahadu Batch**" (or "Genesis Block")! This event also served as the **soft launch of the entire ETN Ecosystem**, setting the stage for our ambitious goal to onboard 30–50 million Ethiopians to the TON blockchain within five years.

The intensive two-month bootcamp, offered free of charge through ETN Learn, successfully equipped over 7,000 Ethiopian 12th-grade students with vital knowledge in Forex Trading, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology, and an Introduction to Web3 and The Open Network (TON).

### Introducing the Ahadu Badge SBT

A highlight of the graduation ceremony was the introduction of the **Ahadu Badge**, a commemorative **Soulbound Token (SBT)** awarded to these pioneering graduates. A total of 192 Ahadu Badges were minted on the TON blockchain, each adorned with unique Ahadu Batch insignia. These non-transferable SBTs are more than just a symbol of achievement; they grant **lifetime access to all courses on the ETN Learn platform**, including premium paid content. This initiative exemplifies our sophisticated approach to community engagement and value delivery, fostering loyalty and demonstrating the practical utility of SBT technology.

The event was further bolstered by a partnership with Exness Limited, a global broker, whose East Africa Regional Head of Sales attended the ceremony. Top-performing students in the trading module were also awarded prizes, including a laptop, tablet, and smartphone.

This collective achievement—the successful graduation of our first batch of Web3-educated individuals, the innovative use of SBTs for credentials and utility, and the soft launch of our ecosystem—creates a powerful narrative of growth, empowerment, and immediate real-world application. We are building a direct pipeline of educated and engaged human capital that will contribute to the vitality, innovation, and overall growth of the entire ETN Ecosystem.
