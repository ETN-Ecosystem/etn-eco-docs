FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA – June 1, 2025 – ET Netsa Apps and Cryptotalk-ET, parent companies of the independently operated ETN Ecosystem (governed by the ETN Council and ETN Foundation), today announced the upcoming launch of Mesewer Books, a groundbreaking Web3 ebook marketplace. The launch is slated for late June 2025.

Mesewer Books, whose name is etymologically derived from the Amharic word "sineMesewer" (ሥነ ምስጢር) meaning cryptography, is set to empower authors, particularly within Africa. The platform will offer an unprecedented 90% revenue share and leverage the efficiency of blockchain technology for instant payouts, exclusively through its native ETN token (ET Netsa Coin).

This innovative platform aims to dismantle the traditional barriers faced by African creators in the digital marketplace. Authors publishing on Mesewer Books will benefit from a transparent 10% commission structure, with immediate access to their earnings facilitated by the TON blockchain's rapid transaction capabilities. There are no minimum withdrawal thresholds or restrictive payout schedules, putting authors firmly in control of their finances.

## Addressing a Critical Gap in E-Commerce

When asked about the motivation behind the platform, ETN Ecosystem Founder Jason Peters, widely known by his social media nickname JP, shared a powerful insight into the challenges faced by African entrepreneurs:

"For as long as I can remember," JP stated, "myself personally and almost everyone that I know has watched videos on YouTube about how to start making money online—startup Drop shipping, sell ebooks, sell DIY trinkets, and all kinds of things. And this has seemed like a pipe dream to most of us because being in Ethiopia, it's not as easy as the content creators in the videos make it out to be. They just sign up for a PayPal account or a Visa/MasterCard merchant account and integrate payment systems in 5 seconds and start making money online."

JP continued, "One of the big issues, hurdles, or whatever you want to call it, that we have as Africans is that nobody really recognizes the market potential that our continent presents to the e-commerce world. It's not that we don't have anything to offer the world, it's not like we don't want to sell anything, it's not like we don't have internet, but none of these service providers have even taken initiative to try and provide services to allow us to be active and engage in e-commerce easily like they do for the rest of the world. What most see as a standard thing is a huge luxury to all of us."

"This is the key principle and foundation that the ETN Ecosystem is built on," he emphasized. "We're trying to provide solutions to problems specifically in the context of Africans being able to make money online without joining some pyramid or Ponzi scheme or some kind of a scam that doesn't rely on bringing in this amount of people and taking commission from their entry fee and that ends up being a big house of cards that all collapses in the end. This ebook platform launch is one out of 17 platforms, each addressing a problem or a niche issue that Ethiopians and Africans as a whole have in joining the e-commerce system that the world has been enjoying for more than a decade. We strive to create a new middle class by using Web3 and blockchain technology, empowering our people."

## Platform Availability and Vision

Mesewer Books will operate exclusively using ETN tokens (ET Netsa Coin) for all transactions. Due to Apple's in-app purchase regulations and this token exclusivity, the Mesewer Books app will be available solely through the Telegram App Center for Android and PC users upon its launch in late June 2025.

This upcoming launch marks a significant step in the ETN Ecosystem's broader mission to develop 17 distinct platforms, each designed to tackle specific challenges and unlock economic opportunities for individuals across Ethiopia and the African continent. By harnessing the power of Web3 and blockchain, the ETN Ecosystem is committed to fostering a new era of financial empowerment and inclusion.
