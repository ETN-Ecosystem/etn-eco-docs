"We’ve always believed that the ability to build apps shouldn’t be limited to those who understand code. ETN Vibe is the missing link between vision and execution," says Jason Peters, founder of ETN Ecosystem.

🔑 Built by Africa. Backed by ByBit.

As part of the broader ETN Ecosystem, ETN Vibe was made possible through a strategic partnership with ByBit Africa. Their support has helped fuel education, access, and infrastructure for African youth in the areas of blockchain, Web3, and financial literacy.

"ByBit Africa's investment in our vision reflects their genuine commitment to the future of African innovation. Their role in making this platform a reality cannot be overstated," said Peters.

Users are encouraged to show support by choosing ByBit as their preferred exchange for crypto, stocks, and forex.

💥 A New Era of App Building

The platform officially enters public beta on July 3, 2025 and is currently free for all users — and is implementing a form of the honor System where they are giving users the option to choose whether this platform remains free or not based on donation volumes however if donations do not meet the required amount of funds to pay for Generation services and platform costs then Paid tiers will be available soon via $ETN, the token powering the entire ETN Ecosystem. Users can expect premium features, more generations, and eventually — agentic AI flows capable of creating apps with zero prompt fatigue.
