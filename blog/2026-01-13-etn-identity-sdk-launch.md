**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## ETN Ecosystem Launches Official Identity SDK to Streamline Web3 Authentication on TON

**ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — January 13, 2026** — ETN Ecosystem today announced the official release of the **ETN Identity SDK** (v1.0.0), a powerful new developer toolkit designed to integrate secure "Sign in with ETN" functionality into decentralized applications (dApps) on the TON Blockchain.

:::info Disambiguation Note
**ETN Ecosystem** is a distinct project built on the **TON Blockchain** and is focused on digital identity and financial inclusion in Africa. We are **not** associated with Electroneum (ETN) or Ethereum (ETH).
:::

As the ETN Ecosystem continues to expand its digital services across Africa and beyond, secure and user-friendly identity management has become a critical need. The new SDK serves as the bridge between complex blockchain cryptography and standard web authentication, allowing developers to implement robust OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows in minutes rather than weeks.

### Simplifying Web3 Identity

The ETN Identity SDK abstracts away the complexities of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, token rotation, and session management. By providing a pre-built, fully typed React library, the ETN Ecosystem is lowering the technical barrier for developers building the next generation of financial and social apps.

"Building secure authentication from scratch is one of the biggest friction points for new developers," said **Jason "JP" Peters**, Founder of the ETN Ecosystem. "With this SDK, we are standardizing how identity works across our network. Whether you are building a DeFi platform or a social dApp, you can now onboard users securely with a single line of code, while we handle the heavy lifting of security and session maintenance in the background."

### Key Features of the SDK

*   **Instant Integration:** Includes a plug-and-play `<ETNConnectButton />` component for React applications.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Full support for OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE and automatic Token Rotation.
*   **Type-Safe:** Written entirely in TypeScript to ensure code reliability and developer productivity.
*   **Open Source:** Fully transparent and available for community contribution on GitHub.

### How to Get Started

The SDK is available immediately via the public npm registry. However, before integrating the library, developers must register their application to obtain the necessary API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).

1.  **Register your App:** Visit the **[ETN Account Platform](https://account.etnecosystem.org/)** to generate your developer credentials.
2.  **Install the SDK:**
    ```bash
    npm install @etn-ecosystem/identity-sdk
    ```
3.  **Build:** Review the documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/ETN-Ecosystem/ETN-Identity-SDK) to implement your first sign-in flow.
