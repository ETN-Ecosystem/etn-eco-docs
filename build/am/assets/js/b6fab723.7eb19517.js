This intensive two-month program, offered free of charge, attracted over 7,000 Ethiopian 12th-grade students and provided courses in Forex Trading, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology, and an Introduction to Web3 and The Open Network (TON).

A total of 192 Ahadu Badges were minted on the TON blockchain at a cost of 0.02 TON each. These SBTs, adorned with unique Ahadu Batch insignia, are not merely symbolic; they grant lifetime access to all courses on the ETN Learn platform, including premium paid content. This initiative was further bolstered by a partnership with Exness Limited, a global broker, whose East Africa Regional Head of Sales attended the ceremony, and prizes including a laptop, tablet, and smartphone were awarded to top-performing students in the trading module.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Ahadu Badge SBT exemplifies a sophisticated approach to community engagement and value delivery.

This feature is designed to foster loyalty among graduates and encourage their continued engagement with the platform, while simultaneously demonstrating the practical and valuable applications of SBT technology. The \"Genesis Block\" narrative powerfully positions these students as foundational members of the ETN Learn community, cultivating a strong sense of belonging and potentially transforming them into early advocates for the ecosystem. The strategic decision to soft-launch the entire ETN Ecosystem at this graduation ceremony created a compelling narrative of growth, empowerment, and immediate real-world application, showcasing the project's impact from its very inception. This creates a positive feedback loop where education cultivates skilled users, who then populate and energize the wider ecosystem, which in turn offers more opportunities for these educated individuals."})]})}function l(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var o=a(6540);const n={},i=o.createContext(n);function s(e){const t=o.useContext(i);return o.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:s(e.components),o.createElement(i.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
