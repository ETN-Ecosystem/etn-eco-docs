            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ETN Ecosystem Launches Mesewer Books: A Web3 Ebook Marketplace Championing African Authors and Revolutionizing E-Commerce Access</strong></p>
<p>ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA – June 16, 2025 – The ETN Ecosystem today announced the launch of Mesewer Books, a groundbreaking Web3 ebook marketplace developed by ET Netsa Apps. This new platform is set to empower authors, particularly within Africa, by offering an unprecedented 90% revenue share and leveraging the efficiency of blockchain technology for instant payouts, exclusively through its native ETN token.</p>
<p>Mesewer Books aims to dismantle the traditional barriers faced by African creators in the digital marketplace. Authors publishing on the platform will benefit from a transparent 10% commission structure, with immediate access to their earnings facilitated by the TON blockchain's rapid transaction capabilities. There are no minimum withdrawal thresholds or restrictive payout schedules, putting authors firmly in control of their finances.</p>

<p>When asked about the motivation behind the platform, ETN Ecosystem Founder Jason Peters, widely known by his social media nickname JP, shared a powerful insight into the challenges faced by African entrepreneurs:</p>
<p>"For as long as I can remember," JP stated, "myself personally and almost everyone that I know has watched videos on YouTube about how to start making money online—startup Drop shipping, sell ebooks, sell DIY trinkets, and all kinds of things. And this has seemed like a pipe dream to most of us because being in Ethiopia, it's not as easy as the content creators in the videos make it out to be. They just sign up for a PayPal account or a Visa/MasterCard merchant account and integrate payment systems in 5 seconds and start making money online."</p>
<p>JP continued, "One of the big issues, hurdles, or whatever you want to call it, that we have as Africans is that nobody really recognizes the market potential that our continent presents to the e-commerce world. It's not that we don't have anything to offer the world, it's not like we don't want to sell anything, it's not like we don't have internet, but none of these service providers have even taken initiative to try and provide services to allow us to be active and engage in e-commerce easily like they do for the rest of the world. What most see as a standard thing is a huge luxury to all of us."</p>
<p>"This is the key principle and foundation that the ETN Ecosystem is built on," he emphasized. "We're trying to provide solutions to problems specifically in the context of Africans being able to make money online without joining some pyramid or Ponzi scheme or some kind of a scam that doesn't rely on bringing in this amount of people and taking commission from their entry fee and that ends up being a big house of cards that all collapses in the end. This ebook platform launch is one out of 17 platforms, each addressing a problem or a niche issue that Ethiopians and Africans as a whole have in joining the e-commerce system that the world has been enjoying for more than a decade. We strive to create a new middle class by using Web3 and blockchain technology, empowering our people."</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="platform-availability-and-vision">Platform Availability and Vision<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/am/blog/etn-ecosystem-launches-mesewer-books#platform-availability-and-vision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Platform Availability and Vision" title="Direct link to Platform Availability and Vision">​</a></h3>
<p>Mesewer Books will operate exclusively using ETN tokens for all transactions. Due to Apple's in-app purchase regulations and this token exclusivity, the Mesewer Books app will be available solely through the Telegram App Center for Android and PC users.</p>
<p>This launch marks a significant step in the ETN Ecosystem's broader mission to develop its planned platforms, each designed to tackle specific challenges and unlock economic opportunities for individuals across Ethiopia and the African continent. By harnessing the power of Web3 and blockchain, the ETN Ecosystem is committed to fostering a new era of financial empowerment and inclusion.</p>

<p>ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA – June 1, 2025 – ET Netsa Apps and Cryptotalk-ET, parent companies of the independently operated ETN Ecosystem (governed by the ETN Council and ETN Foundation), today announced the upcoming launch of Mesewer Books, a groundbreaking Web3 ebook marketplace. The launch is slated for late June 2025.</p>
<p>Mesewer Books, whose name is etymologically derived from the Amharic word "sineMesewer" (ሥነ ምስጢር) meaning cryptography, is set to empower authors, particularly within Africa. The platform will offer an unprecedented 90% revenue share and leverage the efficiency of blockchain technology for instant payouts, exclusively through its native ETN token (ET Netsa Coin).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ETN Ecosystem is excited to announce significant advancements that mark a new phase of maturation, reinforcing our commitment to robust security, active community engagement, and a clearly defined governance structure. These strategic updates strengthen our foundation for sustained growth and increased adoption, particularly within the burgeoning African digital landscape and the broader TON blockchain community.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-developments">Key Developments<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/am/blog/strategic-enhancements-authentication-governance-platform-expansion#key-developments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Developments" title="Direct link to Key Developments">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>1. Enhanced Security with ETN Authenticator:</strong>
We've introduced the ETN Authenticator, a novel NFT-based two-factor authentication (2FA) system. This system leverages "ETN Numbers NFTs" and Wallet Connect to provide unified and secure access across all ETN Ecosystem platforms. By tying 2FA to unique, user-owned digital assets, we're moving beyond traditional methods to align authentication with Web3 principles of user sovereignty and control. This not only enhances security but also increases the utility and intrinsic value of holding ETN Numbers NFTs.</p>
<p><strong>2. Exclusively NFT-Driven Governance:</strong>
Our governance model has been refined to be exclusively driven by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This means that holding $ETN tokens alone no longer grants direct voting rights; instead, decision-making power is now entirely encapsulated and exercised through the ownership of specific governance NFTs. This strategic choice aims to tie influence more directly to specific forms of stake and commitment within the ecosystem. Our governance structure includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SBTs (Soulbound Tokens):</strong> 8 non-transferable SBTs held by the development team, each with 10 votes, ensuring core team stewardship.</li>
<li><strong>Council Minister NFTs:</strong> 10 NFTs, available for 10 TON each, for active community leaders (5 or 10 votes each, clarification pending).</li>
<li><strong>Investor NFTs:</strong> 2 NFTs, priced at 50 TON each, granting 10 votes each for significant stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>$ETN Treasury Bonds:</strong> 200 bonds, each granting 1 vote, functioning as verifiable tokenized assets for broader community participation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Launch of Mesewer Books:</strong>
We are thrilled to announce Mesewer Books, a new platform within our expanding suite of services. While specific details are pending, Mesewer Books is set to diversify our offerings, potentially focusing on content distribution, digital publishing, or specialized record-keeping. This addition underscores our dynamic approach to adding new services that broaden the ecosystem's overall utility and appeal.</p>
<p><strong>4. Commemorating "Ahadu Batch" with Ahadu Badge SBT:</strong>
ETN Learn, our educational arm, celebrated the graduation of its first cohort from the "Ultimate Netsa Summer Bootcamp." To commemorate this milestone, we introduced the Ahadu Badge, a commemorative Soulbound Token (SBT) awarded to these graduates, designated the "Ahadu Batch" or "Genesis Block." These 192 non-transferable SBTs grant lifetime access to all ETN Learn courses, including premium content, fostering loyalty and demonstrating the practical applications of SBT technology.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="synergies-and-outlook">Synergies and Outlook<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/am/blog/strategic-enhancements-authentication-governance-platform-expansion#synergies-and-outlook" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Synergies and Outlook" title="Direct link to Synergies and Outlook">​</a></h3>
<p>These new elements are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing platforms, creating a more cohesive, secure, and utilitarian environment. The ETN Authenticator provides a common security framework, Mesewer Books introduces a new content vertical, and ETN Learn cultivates a skilled user base. This holistic strategy aims to create a virtuous cycle of enhanced security, new value, and continuous education, driving adoption and economic activity across the entire ETN Ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our roadmap for 2024-2027 continues to guide our development, with recent milestones like the GekoTerminal listing and ETN Ads alpha testing demonstrating our progress. We remain committed to securing funding and prioritizing long-term solutions, with a unique sustainability model that involves collecting platform fees in $ETN and distributing them annually to stakeholders, fostering sustainable growth and shared value creation.</p>
<p>The ETN Ecosystem is actively solidifying its core infrastructure and expanding its service offerings, tailored to address the needs and opportunities within the African market, with a strong emphasis on education, practical utility, and financial inclusion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>November 17, 2024, marked a monumental day for the ETN Ecosystem as we celebrated the graduation of the first cohort from the <strong>Ultimate Netsa Summer Bootcamp</strong>, proudly dubbed the "<strong>Ahadu Batch</strong>" (or "Genesis Block")! This event also served as the <strong>soft launch of the entire ETN Ecosystem</strong>, setting the stage for our ambitious goal to onboard 30–50 million Ethiopians to the TON blockchain within five years.</p>
<p>The intensive two-month bootcamp, offered free of charge through ETN Learn, successfully equipped over 7,000 Ethiopian 12th-grade students with vital knowledge in Forex Trading, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology, and an Introduction to Web3 and The Open Network (TON).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-ahadu-badge-sbt">Introducing the Ahadu Badge SBT<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/am/blog/ahadu-batch-graduation-sbt-ecosystem-soft-launch#introducing-the-ahadu-badge-sbt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing the Ahadu Badge SBT" title="Direct link to Introducing the Ahadu Badge SBT">​</a></h3>
<p>A highlight of the graduation ceremony was the introduction of the <strong>Ahadu Badge</strong>, a commemorative <strong>Soulbound Token (SBT)</strong> awarded to these pioneering graduates. A total of 192 Ahadu Badges were minted on the TON blockchain, each adorned with unique Ahadu Batch insignia. These non-transferable SBTs are more than just a symbol of achievement; they grant <strong>lifetime access to all courses on the ETN Learn platform</strong>, including premium paid content. This initiative exemplifies our sophisticated approach to community engagement and value delivery, fostering loyalty and demonstrating the practical utility of SBT technology.</p>
<p>The event was further bolstered by a partnership with Exness Limited, a global broker, whose East Africa Regional Head of Sales attended the ceremony. Top-performing students in the trading module were also awarded prizes, including a laptop, tablet, and smartphone.</p>
<p>This collective achievement—the successful graduation of our first batch of Web3-educated individuals, the innovative use of SBTs for credentials and utility, and the soft launch of our ecosystem—creates a powerful narrative of growth, empowerment, and immediate real-world application. We are building a direct pipeline of educated and engaged human capital that will contribute to the vitality, innovation, and overall growth of the entire ETN Ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce that <strong>ETN Ads</strong> has officially entered its closed alpha testing phase as of October 12, 2024! This marks a significant step forward for the platform, which was developed during a hackathon challenge by a dedicated community member.</p>
<p>ETN Ads is designed to be an innovative advertising portal within the ETN Ecosystem, connecting content creators with potential advertisers and offering a new avenue for revenue generation, especially in regions with limited online payment gateways like Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The transition to closed alpha testing signifies that the core functionalities are in place and are now being rigorously tested by a select group of users. This phase is crucial for gathering valuable feedback, identifying any bugs, and refining the user experience before a broader release.</p>
<p>This milestone highlights our commitment to fostering community-driven product innovation and bringing practical, decentralized solutions to market. We look forward to the insights gained from this testing phase to make ETN Ads a robust and effective platform for all users.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 10, 2024, the ETN Ecosystem community came together to send a special birthday gift to Pavel Durov, the visionary founder of Telegram: a symbolic amount of $ETN tokens.</p>
<p>This gesture was more than just a birthday wish; it was an expression of deep appreciation for the Telegram platform, which serves as a crucial backbone for the ETN Ecosystem and its vibrant community. Telegram's robust and accessible infrastructure has been instrumental in our growth and ability to connect with users across Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>The community's hope is that these $ETN tokens will be held by Pavel Durov until they gain significant value, potentially even enough to fund future Telegram server purchases. This highlights our belief in the long-term potential of $ETN and the symbiotic relationship between the ETN Ecosystem and the broader TON/Telegram network.</p>
<p>This initiative underscores the strong bond and shared vision between the ETN community and the foundational technologies that enable our decentralized solutions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus blogging features</a> are powered by the <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips you might find useful.</p>
<p>Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the <code>blog</code> directory.</p>
<p>Regular blog authors can be added to <code>authors.yml</code>.</p>
<p>The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>2019-05-30-welcome.md</code></li>
<li><code>2019-05-30-welcome/index.md</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Docusaurus Plushie" src="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/am/assets/images/docusaurus-plushie-banner-a60f7593abca1e3eef26a9afa244e4fb.jpeg" width="1500" height="500" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The blog supports tags as well!</p>
<p><strong>And if you don't want a blog</strong>: just delete this directory, and use <code>blog: false</code> in your Docusaurus config.</p>]]></content:encoded>
