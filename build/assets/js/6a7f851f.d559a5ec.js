This model seeks to integrate and weigh the interests of different stakeholder groups. The Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), which possess significant voting power and are non-transferable, are retained by the development team. This design choice ensures continuity in vision and allows for expert input in critical governance decisions, preventing the core leadership's influence from being easily diluted or acquired by external parties. Investor NFTs, characterized by their high price points and substantial voting power, are structured to give a more pronounced voice to larger financial stakeholders who have made a significant commitment to the ecosystem. Council Minister NFTs, which are priced more accessibly than the Investor NFTs yet still require an investment (in TON Coin, not $ETN), offer a middle tier of influence, likely intended for active and committed community members who wish to take on a more formal governance role. Finally, the $ETN Treasury Bonds, presumably acquired using $ETN (though the exact acquisition mechanism is not fully detailed), provide the broadest base for participation, allowing general $ETN holders to have a say in governance with one vote per bond."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This multi-tiered approach appears designed to ensure that development expertise, significant financial investment, and broader community sentiment all have defined avenues for influence within the DAO. Such a structure has the potential to lead to more robust, well-rounded, and resilient decision-making processes. However, this complexity also presents inherent challenges, particularly in terms of ensuring genuinely fair representation across all stakeholder groups and preventing the potential for plutocracy if the balance of power is not carefully managed and periodically reviewed. A notable design choice is the pricing of key governance NFTs (Council Minister and Investor NFTs) in TON Coin rather than $ETN. This may be a strategic decision aimed at attracting external capital directly into the governance layer of the ecosystem, or to ensure that governance participation is funded by a more established and liquid asset on the TON network. This detailed NFT-based governance system represents a significant evolution from the simpler statement in the original $ETN Whitepaper, which generally mentioned that $ETN holders would have voting rights, indicating a maturation of the project's governance philosophy towards a more structured and nuanced framework."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>o,x:()=>a});var i=t(6540);const s={},r=i.createContext(s);function o(e){const n=i.useContext(r);return i.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}},[n,e])}function a(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:o(e.components),i.createElement(r.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
