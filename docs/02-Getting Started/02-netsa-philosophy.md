The name "**Netsa**" (ነፃ) is derived from Amharic, the national language of Ethiopia, and translates to “free,” "freedom," or "liberation." This powerful word encapsulates the core principles and ethos of the ETN Ecosystem.

In the context of our project, "Netsa" emphasizes our unwavering commitment to the ideals of autonomy and empowerment that are fundamental to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. It reflects the spirit of decentralization and financial freedom championed by The Open Network (TON) blockchain, upon which our ecosystem is built.

By integrating this concept into our identity, we underscore our dedication to liberating individuals and communities from traditional financial constraints and empowering them through decentralized solutions.
