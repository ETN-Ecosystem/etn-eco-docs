### Initial Valuation (from Whitepaper V1.1)

The initial valuation of $ETN was determined by its pairing in the liquidity pool.
*   **Liquidity Pool:** 2,000,000 $ETN paired with 200 TON.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Valuation of 1 $ETN = (200 TON) / (2,000,000 ETN) = 1/10,000 TON
*   This established the initial price of each $ETN token at 1/10,000 of a TON token.

This updated tokenomics structure emphasizes long-term sustainability, community engagement, and the strategic allocation of resources to foster the growth and utility of the ETN Ecosystem.
