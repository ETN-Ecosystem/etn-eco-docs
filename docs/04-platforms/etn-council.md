# ETN Council

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization â€“ Running

The ETN Council is the official Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) of the ecosystem. Users can participate in governance and vote on proposals not based on the amount of tokens they hold, but rather by purchasing available NFTs from the ETN Archives collection and holding ETN Treasury Bonds. This multi-tiered system ensures balanced representation.
