# 🆔 ETN Identity

**Category:** User Protocols & Web3 Primitives
**Audience:** End Users, Governance Participants

---

## **Overview**

**ETN Identity** is a Web3-native identity protocol that establishes a new global standard for digital sovereignty, consent, and data ownership. While it is built on sophisticated cryptographic proofs, for the end user, it offers a seamless **"Sign in with ETN"** experience that rivals the ease of Web2 platforms like Google or Apple—without the data exploitation.

In a world where governments are increasingly enforcing mandatory, surveillance-heavy digital IDs, ETN Identity offers a radical alternative: **Voluntary, Pseudonymous, and Sovereign.** We do not force you to digitize your real-world documents. Whether you want to be a public influencer or a completely anonymous ghost, the choice is 100% yours.

## **Core Philosophy**

### **1. Self-Sovereign Ownership**

You are not a product. Your identity is derived from your cryptographic keys, not a database entry owned by a corporation. We built ETN Identity on a simple, non-negotiable principle: **you own your data. Full stop.**

### **2. Truly Private. Truly Yours.**

We are a zero-knowledge platform regarding your offline life. We **never** ask you to link government documents (Passports/IDs) to your account. We don't ask for your email or phone number, we don't log your activity, and we will never sell your data. Your identity is anchored to your wallet, not our servers.

### **3. Be Who You Want (The Optional Name)**

You can stay completely anonymous or build a public profile. Providing a name is strictly **optional** and exists to support two distinct ecosystem utilities:

* **ETN Learn Certificates:** Our learning platform issues on-chain verifiable credentials. To be valid for employment or education, these specific certifications require a legal name.
* **Web3 Social Influence:** Influencers on our social platforms often choose to be "known" to build their personal brand and reputation.
* *If you are not certifying your skills or building a public brand, you never need to share a name.*

### **4. The Right to Exit**

True ownership requires the ability to leave. ETN Identity includes a cryptographically guaranteed "Right to Exit," allowing users to permanently execute a self-sovereign account deletion that purges their data from the ecosystem. Unlike Web2 platforms that hold data hostage, this is an immediate, irreversible erasure.

### **5. Guaranteed Authenticity**

Every login, agreement, and governance action is secured at the cryptographic layer, creating an immutable record of consent.

---

## **Legal & Jurisdictional Framework**

ETN Identity operates within a defined "Dual-Jurisdictional" legal framework designed for global enforceability and predictability.

1. **Prescriptive Compliance (Ethiopia):** The platform’s digital signatures are architected to meet the technical requirements for a "Reliable Electronic Signature" under **Proclamation No. 1205/2020**.
2. **Permissive Validity (Delaware, USA):** The architecture satisfies the "intent to sign" requirements of the **Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA)**.

## **User Experience Protocols**

ETN Identity leverages a **Hybrid Protocol Strategy** to balance security with ease of use.

### **1. The Digital Passport (`ton_proof`)**

For daily interactions, the protocol uses `ton_proof`—a low-friction authentication method.

* **Usage:** Standard sign-ins and re-entry into authorized apps.
* **Experience:** Instant, one-click access without repetitive signing requests.

### **2. The Digital Contract (`signData`)**

For high-stakes actions, the protocol invokes `signData` to create explicit, legally enforceable consent.

* **Usage:** Agreeing to Terms of Service, authorizing a new app for the first time, or executing the "Right to Exit."
* **Experience:** A clear, readable message appears in your wallet requiring a specific signature to confirm your intent.

---

## **Data Privacy Promise**

* **Fiduciary Duty:** The Platform accepts a fiduciary duty to protect your privacy.
* **No Hidden Sharing:** Your data is never sold, leased, or traded.
* **On-Chain Consent:** Data is only shared with third-party applications when you explicitly authorize it via a cryptographic signature.
