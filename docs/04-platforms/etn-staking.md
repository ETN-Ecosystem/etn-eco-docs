# 🛡️ ETN Staking: A User's Guide

## Why stake instead of just holding?
When you keep $ETN in your wallet, it sits idle. It’s safe, but it’s not growing.
Staking puts your $ETN to work. By locking your tokens in the secure ETN-ECO vault, you earn *more* $ETN automatically. It is the difference between keeping cash under your mattress vs. putting it in a high-yield savings account.

### ⚙️ How it Works (The Mechanics)

When you open the staking interface, you are making a deal: you promise to lock away your tokens for a set time, and in return, the ecosystem pays you interest (APR).

#### 1. Choose Your Commitment Level (Time)
We offer three "Unstaking periods." The longer you lock your tokens, the higher your reward multiplier.

* **182 Days (6 Months):** Standard rewards. (Current APR: ~10.21%)
* **365 Days (1 Year):** High rewards. You get a 1.9x multiplier on your earnings. (Current APR: ~19.39%)
* **730 Days (2 Years):** Maximum rewards. You get a 2x multiplier. (Current APR: ~20.42%)

*Note: APR (Annual Percentage Rate) fluctuates based on how many people are in the pool.*

#### 2. The Rules of Entry

* **Minimum Deposit:** You need at least 3,000 $ETN to start staking.
* **Deposit Fee:** There is a small 3% fee taken from your deposit immediately. This goes back into the ecosystem/pool health. *Example: If you deposit 3,000, you effectively start staking with 2,910.*

### ⚠️ Important: Early Withdrawal Consequences

This is the most critical part to understand. Staking is designed for Diamond Hands—people committed to the long-term success of ETN.

* **The 20% Unstake Fee:** If you need to access your funds, there is a 20% unstake fee.
* **Why?** This protects the token price and loyal holders from "pump and dump" behavior. It ensures that people don't just stake for a day and leave.
* **Strategy:** Only stake funds you are comfortable not touching for the duration of your chosen period. If you withdraw early, this fee will eat into your principal.

### 📝 Step-by-Step for First-Timers

1. **Connect:** Click the "Connect Wallet" button at the top right and select your TON wallet.
2. **Select Period:** Tap on 182, 365, or 730 days. The interface will highlight your choice.
3. **Enter Amount:** Type in how much $ETN you want to stake (or click "Max"). Remember, it must be at least 3,000.
4. **Check Gas:** Ensure you have a small amount of TON (approx 0.5 TON) in your wallet to pay for the blockchain transaction fees.
5. **Stake:** Click the big "Stake" button and confirm the transaction in your wallet app.

## Summary
By staking, you are increasing your bag size automatically while supporting the stability of the ETN Ecosystem. Choose the timeframe that suits your financial goals, sit back, and watch the rewards pile up!
